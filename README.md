# DerpiViewer
View and download Derpibooru pictures

## Instructions
 - Enter a query in the search bar, just as you would on Derpibooru, and click the magnifying glass button to load them. Click it again, to load another page. And another. And another...
 - Use the number input next to searchbar to manually select which page you want to load
 - Click the next button over (the one with a folder icon) to open your current download folder
 - Click the down arrow button to download all files on the list.
 - Click the hamburger button to open the main menu, where you can change colour scheme, download destination, and your token.

## Keyboard shortcuts
 - [Esc] to go back to list view
 - [A] and [D] to go back and forth between images
 - [W] to download currently viewed image
 
## Notes
 - Batch download downloads all pictures currently in the list view, doesn;t skip the ones that were already downloaded
 - If a picture is exceptionally large (some .mp4 files, or pictures in ungodly resolutions), the application might seem like it's not responding. It jumps back to action as soon as the file loads, however, so there's no impact on usability.
 
## Token 
To view some files (explicit, gore, etc) you must provide your personal API token in the application settings.
To procure such a token, you need to log in to Derpibooru, click your avatar in the top-right corner, select _Account_, and the key will be at the very top.
Couldn't be any easier.

Adding a token to the application will make it respect some of your user settings. For example, how many picures per fetch the application displays.
